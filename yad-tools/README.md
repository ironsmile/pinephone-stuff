# Yad Tools

This is a collection of [yad](https://github.com/v1cont/yad) tools
alog with `.desktop` files so that they could be run from the phone's
launcher.

Scripts should go into the executable `$PATH`. Typically I am pacing them
in `${HOME}/bin`.

Desktop files should go into `${HOME}/.local/share/applications/`.
