# Squeekboard Layouts

These are my squeekboard layouts hand-crafted to be much more useful
than the default ones.

Particuarly, I am trying to mimic the iPhone's keyboard as much as
possible so that I don't have to remember two touch keyboards.

All files here should go into `~/.local/share/squeekboard/keyboards/`
and will override the default layouts for the particular language.

Instructions on how to modify and create layouts:
